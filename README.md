# CashFlow

CashFlow is an application that helps you manage your finances.
You can add wallets or bank accounts in it and manage your expenses and incomes like a register. All data stays on your local device.

## Who am I

I am a theoretical physicist that enjoys to write code. This is my first Android application and I hope you like it, I am developing it for fun as side project in my free/spare time.  
You can find me on LinkedIn as [Zhou Zheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhou-zheng-974b14167/).

## Features in backlog

So far the application has only the basic features, in the backlog of this project there are:
- A budget system to manage your expense limits.
- A section with graphs and plots in order to visualize your incomes and expenses.
- A backup system that saves the transactions on your Google Drive.
- An HTTP server to access the application from the web browser in order to use a computer to perform the actions.

In order to make the navigation more enjoyable, the following features will be implemented in future:
- Animations and transitions for in app navigation.
- Better theming.

## Build types

The project can be compiled based on 5 build types:
- **debug**: build used to perform automatic ui testing. It does not include any preloaded transaction data.
- **dev**: build used to perform manual ui testing. It includes preloaded transactions.
- **staging**: build with the most recent stable release and staging data. It should be equal to the last working dev build.
- **preprod**: build used to test the database migration from the last production build if the database version changes.
- **release**: production build.
